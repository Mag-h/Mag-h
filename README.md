# 👋 Hi, I’m Maguelonne Héritier  



I am a **Computer Vision and Machine Learning Lead** with 20+ years of experience in **AI research and industry**.  

My career is dedicated to designing **responsible AI systems** that are interpretable, reliable, and impactful — particularly in **critical security applications**.  



---



## 🔐 Current Focus  

- **Physical security & video surveillance systems**: designing AI that operates in high-stakes, mission-critical contexts  

- **Responsible AI**: embedding interpretability and transparency into models by design  

- **Embedded analytics**: developing efficient deep learning solutions for constrained hardware, ensuring performance under strict resource limitations  

- **Reliability first**: delivering models that meet industrial requirements for robustness, safety, and trustworthiness  



---



## 🏆 Highlights  

- Lead R&D in **AI for physical security** at Genetec (2017–present)  

- Expertise in **interpretable and trustworthy AI** for surveillance systems, where accountability is essential  

- Patents and publications bridging **academic research and industrial R&D**  

- Former specialist at Matrox, designing patented computer vision algorithms  

- Senior Research Engineer at CRIM – *1st place at TRECVID 2009 Video Copy Detection Challenge*  



---



## 📚 Selected Publications  

- **EXaM**: Concept-based representation learning for explainability – *CVPR Workshop 2025* (Spotlight)  

- **CenterPoly**: Real-time instance segmentation – *ICCV 2021*  

- **RN-VID**: Video object detection – *ICIAR 2020, Best Paper*
