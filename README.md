## 🌍 My Vision  




AI has the greatest impact when academic excellence meets industrial deployment.
My journey has been about building this bridge, transforming research into products that matter.
In recent years, I have focused on ensuring that this impact is responsible and ethical, especially in critical physical security applications.
For me, responsible AI means models that are interpretable, efficient, reliable, and that also protect privacy and respect human rights.
