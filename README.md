## üåç My Vision  




AI has the greatest impact when **academic excellence** meets **industrial deployment**.
My journey has been about building this bridge, transforming research into products that matter.
In recent years, I have focused on ensuring that this impact is responsible and ethical, especially in critical physical security applications.
For me, **responsible AI** means models that are **interpretable**, **efficient**, **reliable**, and that also **protect privacy** and **respect human rights**.
